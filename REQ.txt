Create Router with two routes. 
	- Chairs
		path: '/chairs'
	- Books
		path: '/foo/books'
		
Implement 3 views each as a separate template
	- home
	- chairs
	- books

Details on the Books view
	The book view reads from a text input and displays the result text with all vowels removed.
	
Details on the Chairs view
	The chair view allows names of chairs to be added to a list.
	
Other details
	Separate the navbar section from the individual view templates
	Set the 'active' class on the nav bar item for the template currently viewed.
		
**Implement with straight javascript and ember! No use of other frameworks (e.g. don't rig it with JQUERY).**
